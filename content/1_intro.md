**Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth** and I work at the University of Idaho Library as the [Digital Initiatives Librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (CDIL) department. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department.

The short talk that I will be giving today is a part of a [larger workshop](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/geolocation/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} I created for the 2024 Information Landscapes series on using geolocation tools to identify archival photographs that lack location metadata. While I am in no way an expert in GIS, my work in digital scholarship regularly has me jumping into various fields and experimenting with them to see if they could be useful to a broader range of student and faculty researchers. With this in mind, I hope this survey is a helpful insight of *an outsider's* perspective on the strengths and challenges of current, free to use aerial time lapse applications.
