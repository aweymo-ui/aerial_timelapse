## Conclusion

In conclusion, I hope this has been an insightful comparison of these platforms and their various strengths and weaknesses for researchers of varying technical abilities. If students or faculty reach out for a recommendation for a tool that can use and they only need 20 or so years of coverage, I am very likely to recommend the ArcGIS World Imagery Wayback platform as an extremely intuitive option. 

That said, I am personally very interested in creating more work in Google Earth Engine and the seemingly limitless ability you have to produce still, moving and interactive maps. I also feel like I am missing some central concepts of the code that would weed out so many of the false positives, incomplete images and datasets with conflicting color configurations.

Thank you for your time!
